Time Zone Converter

The idea for this project came from a specific task. I'm looking for a job, but employers from America and Europe are in other time zones. Therefore, I needed an service that would help me correctly assign the time for the interview.
Also I thought that it would be nice at the same time to study the new framework - AngularJS.
So, I spent one evening and got a useful service and learned the basics of AngularJS.
